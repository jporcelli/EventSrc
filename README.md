EventSrc
========

Everyone knows that feeling when you arrive in a new area and you want to know what is happening but dont know where to look, or who to ask. At best you may have to search through multiple sources of event data and aggregate it your self.
Event source uses geo spatial analysis to provide users with everything happening around them!
=======

Currently using Django, utilizing Geo-Django, Google maps, and running a Postgres backend. The site is intended to be very dynamic and provide an excellent UX so it makes heavy use of javascript for maintaining a dynamic enviroment and reducing page loads where possible.
